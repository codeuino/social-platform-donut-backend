#### Package descriptions

- bcrypt :- hash your plain password and store hashed password in database.
- body-parser :- Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.bodyproperty.
- express :- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- jsonwebtoken :- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- mongoose :- Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- morgan :- HTTP request logger middleware for node.js.
- nodemon :- nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.


These are the Donut APIs

## API Response Format
The response body for all the APIs will use the following format and it will contain one of them ( data | errors ).
<pre>
{
    data: {
        /../
    },
    errors: {
        /../
    }
}
</pre>
    
## Error Objects
Error objects provide additional information about problems encountered while performing an operation. Error objects MUST be returned as an array keyed by errors in the top level of a JSON:API document.

### An error object MAY have the following members:

- `status` : the HTTP status code applicable to this problem, expressed as a string value.
- `code` : an application-specific error code, expressed as a string value.
- `title` : a short, human-readable summary of the problem that SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization.
- `detail` : a human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem. Like title, this fieldâ€™s value can be localized.

## Allowed HTTPs requests:
<pre>
POST    : To create resource 
PATCH   : To Update resource
GET     : Get a resource or list of resources
DELETE  : To delete resource
</pre>
